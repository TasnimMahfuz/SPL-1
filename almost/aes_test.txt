It is unfortunate that even with the advancement in maternal healthcare in general, it is the poor who are having to suffer disproportionately due to lack of access to quality healthcare. In urban slums, for example, women often prefer to give birth at home because of poverty and miss out on the recommended antenatal care (ANC) check-ups. In fact, many women develop fistula for not having access to quality maternal care during pregnancies and at childbirth.



There are doubts about whether the number of fistula patients recorded is a true representation of the real picture as many women do not speak openly about ailments pertaining to reproductive health due to sociocultural issues. That so many women – there are nearly half a million globally – still suffer from fistula, despite it being preventable, is reflective of gross inequities. It is a sign that inequality is still embedded in the healthcare system with the poor particularly vulnerable, as they also are in case of any health emergency.
